Upload anything you did for the website that isn't straight code. This could be:

- Mockups / Design ideas
- Links to resources outside of github that were created (Google docs, Canva, Figma etc. Pretty much anything)

If it's for learning, don't put it here. Put it in the learning repo here: https://github.com/hack-rpi/HackRPI-RCOS-Learning

If you have any questions make sure to ask me (I'm Jackson Baimel / BastedEggsRYummy) and I'll help you out.
